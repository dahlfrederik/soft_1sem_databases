    "1. Go to the official HBase docker github following this [link](https://github.com/big-data-europe/docker-hbase) and clone the repository. We named the folder `docker-hbase`. Make sure that you have a docker installation. \n",
    "2. Go to the cloned folder and open the `docker-compose-distributed-local.yml` file in your favorite texteditor. In the file scroll down to the hbase-master block and change the ports to: \n",
    "\t`- 16010:9090`\n",
    "Make sure that you save your changes. \n",
    "3. In the cloned folder go to the folder called hmaster and open the file called: `Dockerfile` in your texteditor. Update the expose part to look like this. `EXPOSE 9090 16000 16010`. Save it and close the texteditor. \n",
    "4. Open a CLI window in the main folder `docker-hbase` and run the following docker command: \n",
    "`docker-compose -f docker-compose-distributed-local.yml up -d`\n",
    "5. Open a CLI window using the docker UI in the hbase-master docker environment. \n",
    "From here run the command: `hbase thrift start`. \n",
    "6. Download the dataset from [MyPyramid Raw Food](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mypyramid-food-raw-data) and place in a folder called `myfoodapediadata`. \n",
    "7. In this jupyter file make sure that the path to the `Food_Display_Table.xlsx` file is correct. \n",
    "8. Run the program and watch the magic happen. You have now inserted a lot of data. \n",
    "9. Open a new CLI window in the hbase-master docker environment and run the command `hbase shell`. Now it is possible to do all the queries you can imagine. [See the HBase documentation for inspiration](https://hbase.apache.org/book.html). \n",
